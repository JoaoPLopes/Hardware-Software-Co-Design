# Hardware-Software-Co-Design

Convolutional Neural Network image classification of handwritten digits implemented in FPGAs.

Multiprocessor system in a FPGA - Embedded (heterogeneous) multiprocessor(s) with hardware accelerator(s). - parallelization/hardware acceleration.

The project was developed for the course [Hardware/Software Co-Design](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/disciplinas/-HW645111326/2018-2019/2-semestre/pagina-inicial) in my masters program at IST.
